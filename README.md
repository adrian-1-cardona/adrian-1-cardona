# Hi, I'm Adrian! 

I'm a Computer Science student at Cal Poly passionate about web development, databases, and building meaningful tech solutions.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To
-  I'm currently working on updating the Math and Science's website at Cal Poly as a Web Development Intern.
-  I'm taking Systems Programming (where I'm learning how hardware and software interact), and learning how to build and scale databases in my databases class.
-  On my own I'm exploring Data Structures & Algorithms, Data Management, and Data Administration. Through my own personal research/ work or through a professors office hours.
-  Active member of ColorStack, which is an organization that sets to empowering the next generation of African American and Hispanic/Latino students through networking events.
-  Fun Fact: I like to work out and just bought an arduino kit and I'm looking to learn/ build/ break some arduino motor projects because I think it's cool.
